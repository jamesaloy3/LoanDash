# LoanDash

Standalone offline dashboard for viewing loan document analysis JSON files.

## Generate JSON

Use the prompt in [`PromptV2.txt`](PromptV2.txt) with your language model to produce a structured JSON analysis of a loan agreement.

## Use the dashboard

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (no server required).
2. Click **Add JSON** or drag one or more JSON files onto the page.
3. Switch between loans, filter items, and export CSV summaries as needed.
4. Use **Save Dashboard** to download a copy of the page with loaded data for offline sharing.

The page is completely self-contained and does not require an internet connection.
